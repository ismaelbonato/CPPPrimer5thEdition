# Chapter 3. Strings, Vectors, and Arrays

### How to compile:

GCC 6.0+ or clang 3.3+

`g++ -std=c++11 app_name.cpp -o target`

`clang++ -std=c++11 app_name.cpp -o target`

#### [Exercise 3.1:](Exercise_01)

*Rewrite the exercises from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 13) and ยง 2.6.2 (p. 76) with appropriate using declarations.*

**Answer**:

- [Exercise 1.09](Exercise_01/Ex01_09.cpp)
- [Exercise 1.10](Exercise_01/Ex01_10.cpp)
- [Exercise 1.11](Exercise_01/Ex01_11.cpp)
- [Exercise 1.21](Exercise_01/Ex01_20.cpp)
- [Exercise 1.22](Exercise_01/Ex01_21.cpp)
- [Exercise 1.23](Exercise_01/Ex01_23.cpp)
- [Exercise 1.25](Exercise_01/Ex01_25.cpp)

#### [Exercise 3.2:](Exercise_02) 

*Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time. Modify your program to read a word at a time.*

**Answer**

- [Exercise 3.2A](Exercise_02/Ex02A.cpp)
- [Exercise 3.2B](Exercise_02/Ex02B.cpp)

#### Exercise 3.3:

*Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the `getline` function.*

**Answer**

- **String**: In `string` operator `stream` a whitespace is handled as a newline, when a whitespace is found the stream is finalized but without the whitespace.
- **Getline**: In this function a whitespace is handled like any other character, it copies te whole line until a `newline` is found.

#### [Exercise 3.4:](Exercise_04) 

*Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if not, report which is longer.*

**Answer**
- [Exercise 3.4A](Exercise_04/Ex04A.cpp)
- [Exercise 3.4B](Exercise_04/Ex04B.cpp)


#### [Exercise 3.5:](Exercise_03/Ex05.cpp) 

*Write a program to read strings from the standard input, concatenating what is read into one large string. Print the concatenated string. Next, change the program to separate adjacent input strings by a space.*

**Answer**
- [Exercise 3.5A](Exercise_05/Ex05A.cpp)
- [Exercise 3.5B](Exercise_05/Ex05B.cpp)
