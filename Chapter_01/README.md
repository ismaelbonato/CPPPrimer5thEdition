# Chapter 1: Getting Started

## [Exercise 1.1:](Chapter_01/Exercise_01/Ex01.cpp) 
Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

```
/* https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.1/gcc/Overall-Options.html#index-file-name-suffix-71
 *
 * C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header.
 * file.cc
 * file.cp
 * file.cxx
 * file.cpp
 * file.CPP
 * file.c++
 * file.C
*/
```
## [Exercise 1.2:](Chapter_01/Exercise_01/Ex02.cpp) 
Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun our program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

## [Exercise 1.3:](Chapter_01/Exercise_01/Ex03.cpp) 
 Write a program to print Hello, World on the standard output.
