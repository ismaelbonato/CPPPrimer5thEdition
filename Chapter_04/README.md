# Chapter 4. Expressions

### How to compile:

GCC 6.0+ or clang 3.3+

`g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++11 target`

`clang++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++11 target`

## 4.1.2. Precedence and Associativity

### Exercise 4.1:

*What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2?*

**Answer**

- Result is equal to 105.

```cpp
x = 5 + ((10 * 20)/2);
```

### Exercise 4.2: 

*Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:*

```cpp
(a) * vec.begin()
(b) * vec.begin() + 1
```
**Answer**

```cpp
(a) *( vec.begin() )
(b) ( *( vec.begin() ) + ( 1 ) )
```
## 4.1.3. Order of Evaluation

### Exercise 4.3: 

*Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?*

**Answer**

- I don't think it worth it to bring if instability and unknown behaviors in order to optimize a code, it can become very difficult to find and handle those problems.

## 4.2. Arithmetic Operators

### [Exercise 4.4:](Exercise_04/Ex04.cpp)

Parenthesize the following expression to show how it is
evaluated. Test your answer by compiling the expression (without
parentheses) and printing its result.

```cpp
12 / 3 * 4 + 5 * 15 + 24 % 4 / 2
```
**Answer**

- The result is equal to: 91 

```cpp
( ((12 / 3) * 4) + (5 * 15) + ((24 % 4) / 2) )
```

**Output**

```cpp
./a.out 
91
```

### Exercise 4.5:

*Determine the result of the following expressions.*

```cpp
(a) -30 * 3 + 21 / 5
(b) -30 + 3 * 21 / 5
(c) 30 / 3 * 21 % 5
(d) -30 / 3 * 21 % 4
```
**Answer**

```cpp
(a) ( -(30 * 3) + (21 / 5) )  // result = -86
(b) (-30 + ( (3 * 21) / 5 ) ) // result = -18
(c) ( ((30 / 3) * 21) % 5 )   // result = 0
(d) ( (-(30 / 3) * 21) % 4)   // result = -2
```

### [Exercise 4.6:](Exercise_06/Exl06.cpp) 

*Write an expression to determine whether an int value is even or odd.

**Answer**
```cpp
( (n % 2) == 0) //if true it`s odd if not even 
```

### Exercise 4.7: 

*What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will overflow.*

**Answer**

- Overflow means the number is greater than its type representation.

```cpp
// first: a char can represent a number from 0 to 254
unsigned char x = 254; // x = 0
x += 1; 

// Second:
unsigned char y = 26; // y = 5
y *= 10;

unsigned char z = 0; // z = 254
z -= 1;
```

## 4.3. Logical and Relational Operators

### Exercise 4.8: 

*Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical `AND`, logical `OR`, and equality operators.*

**Answer**
- The evaluation order of `AND` operator begin from the left to right, the right side of this operation will be evaluated only if the left side is `true`.
- The evaluation order of `OR` operator begin from the left to right, the right side of this operation will be evaluated only if the left side is `false`.
- The evaluation order of `==` operator is not defined by the language.


### Exercise 4.9: 

*Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:*

```cpp
const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)
```
**Answer**

- In this condition the left `cp` and right side `*cp` will be converted to `bool`, the left side will be tested, if false, the right side of this will be ignored.
- As result, it will be always true, because `cp` is an address to some point in the memory.

### Exercise 4.10: 

*Write the condition for a `while` loop that would read `ints` from the standard input and stop when the value read is equal to 42.*

**Answer**

```cpp
while ( (std::cin >> x) && (x == 42) ) {}
```

### Exercise 4.11: 

*Write an expression that tests four values, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and ensures that `a` is greater than `b`, which is greater than `c`, which is greater than `d`.*

**Answer**

```cpp
if (a > b && b > c && c > d) {}
```

### Exercise 4.12:

*Assuming `i`, `j`, and `k` are all `ints`, explain what `i != j < k` means.*

**Answer**

- First the precedence is `( i != (j < k) )`.
- The result of `j < k` expression has a type a `bool` that will be converted in an `int` of value `1` or `0` and it will be compared with an `int i`. If `i` is different of `0` or `1` this expression will not work as intended, any value for `i` different of `0` or `1` will give an meaningless result equal to  `true`.

## 4.4. Assignment Operators

### Exercise 4.13: 

*What are the values of i and d after each assignment?*
```cpp
int i; double d;
(a) d = i = 3.5;
(b) i = d = 3.5;
```
**Answer**

- **(a)** - `i = 3`, `d = 3.0`
- **(b)** - `d = 3.5`, `i = 3` 

### Exercise 4.14: 

*Explain what happens in each of the if tests:*

```cpp
(a) if (42 = i) // ...
(b) if (i = 42) // ...
```
**Answer**

- **(a)** - It's ilegal because a literal cannot be an `lvalue`, in another word, a literal cannot be assigned.
- **(b)** - The assignment will be performed the expression `i = 42` will return an `int` value equal to 42, so, this test will never be false, in order to fix for this statement we need to use the compare operator `i == 42` and not the assignment operator.  

### Exercise 4.15: 

*The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct it?*

```cpp
double dval; 
int ival; 
int *pi;

dval = ival = pi = 0;
```

**Answer**
- This assignment is illegal, `pi` is a pointer and there is no such thing as an automatic conversion from `int*` to `int` type.

```cpp
    double dval; 
    int ival; 
    int *pi = nullptr;

    dval = ival = 0;
```


### Exercise 4.16: 

*Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.*

```cpp
(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
(b) if (i = 1024)
```
**Answer**

- **(a)** - It will not work as expected because assignment has low precedence, it means that `getPtr() != 0` will be processed before the assignment, in order to fix this exercise the use of of parenthesis is required.
    ```cpp
    if ( (p = getPtr()) != 0)
    ```

- **(b)** - It's legal but it will always give true as result of this statement, the correct way to write this is using the `compare` operator and not the `assignment` operator.
    ```cpp
    if (i == 1024)
    ```

## 4.5. Increment and Decrement Operators

### Exercise 4.17: 

*Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.*

**Answer**

- **`Prefix`** has high precedence, it increments or decreases an object by 1, the result is itself.
- **`Postfix`** has also high precedence, it increments or decreases an object by 1 and the result is its old itself, it means it increments or decrease the object by 1, after that, it creates a temporary object to store the old value before de increment and return this object.

### Exercise 4.18: 

*What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?*

```cpp
auto pbeg = v.begin();
// print elements up to the first negative value
while (pbeg != v.end() && *beg >= 0)
cout << *++pbeg << endl;
```
**Answer**

- If we use the prefix increment operator, it will start to print from the second element in the vector up to the negative number (with the negative number included).

### Exercise 4.19: 

*Given that `ptr` points to an `int`, that `vec` is a `vector<int>`, and that `ival` is an `int`, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?*

```cpp
(a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++
(b) ival++ && ival
(c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]
```

- **(a)** - This expression is correct, in this expression `!=` has precedence, so, first `ptr != 0` will be computed. This ensure that the expression `*ptr++` will be performed only if ptr is different of `nulptr`.
It's a great way we can test and use a pointer in the same expression because of the operator `&&` process left side  first.
- **(b)** - This expression verifies first the left side of the arithmetics, if `ival++` is true, the right side will be tested `ival` but incremented by 1. This expression is meaningless, therefore it's incorrect.
    ```cpp
    ival && (ival + 1)
    ```

- **(c)** - It is incorrect, its behavior is undetermined because we don't know what side of the equation will be performed first when using this operator.
    ```cpp
    vec[ival] <= vec[ival + 1]
    ```

## 4.6. The Member Access Operators

### Exercise 4.20: 

*Assuming that `iter` is a `vector<string>::iterator`, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.*

```cpp
(a) *iter++;
(b) (*iter)++;
(c) *iter.empty();
(d) iter->empty();
(e) ++*iter;
(f) iter++->empty();
```

**Answer**

- **(a)** - **Legal**: `iter` will be incremented and it will return a copy of it with the value before the increment, the copy will be dereferenced instead of the original and then `iter` will be incremented. 
- **(b)** - **Illegal**: String cannot be incremented.
- **(c)** - **Illegal**: `dot` operator has higher precedence than the dereference operator, that so, `iter` as an `vector<string>::iterator` type has not a member called `empty()`.
- **(d)** - **Legal**: `iter` will be dereferenced and then the result of this will try access the function member `empty()`.
- **(e)** - **Illegal**: it's illegal because it tries to increment and operator. 
- **(f)** - **Legal**: `iter` will be incremented and it will return the old itself as a copy, so, it will be dereferenced and then it will try to access the function member called `empty()`, last `iter` will be incremented.

## 4.7. The Conditional Operator

### [Exercise 4.21:](Exercise_21/Ex21.cpp)

*Write a program to use a conditional operator to find the elements in a `vector<int>` that have odd value and double the value of each such element.*

### Exercise 4.22:

*Extend the program that assigned high pass, pass, and fail grades to also assign low pass for grades between 60 and 75 inclusive. Write two versions: One version that uses only conditional operators; the other should use one or more if statements. Which version do you think is easier to understand and why?*

- [Exercise 4.22A:](Exercise_22/Ex22A.cpp)
- [Exercise 4.22B:](Exercise_22/Ex22B.cpp)

**Answer**

- The version with if statement is easier to write and understand specially when we avoid nested statements.

### Exercise 4.23: 

*The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence. Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you fix it?*

```cpp
string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;
```

**Answer**

- It fails because the operator `+` has more precedence than the operator `==`, that so, the comparison between a `string` and a `char` literal `'s'` is illegal. We can have a better intuition of what's happening when we use Parenthesis to show the precedence.
    ```cpp
    string pl = ( (s + s[s.size() - 1]) == 's') ? "" : "s" ;
    ``` 

- In order to fix this expression we need to use parenthesis in the right place, as we can see below.
    ```cpp
    string pl = s + ( (s[s.size() - 1] == 's') ? "" : "s");
    ``` 
### Exercise 4.24:

*Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative.*

**Answer**

- If the conditional operator is left associative, it will evaluate this section of the code first `(grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)`, if the result was `"high pass"` it will always give the result fail `"high pass" ? "fail" : "pass"`, otherwise, if the result is `(grade < 60)` it will work as expected `(grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass"`;

    ```cpp
    ( (grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60) ) ? "fail" : "pass";
    ```

## 4.8. The Bitwise Operators

### Exercise 4.25:

*What is the value of `~'q' << 6` on a machine with 32-bit `ints` and 8 bit `chars`, that uses `Latin-1` character set in which `'q'` has the `bit` pattern `01110001`?*

**Answer**

- First 'q' will be promoted to an `signed int = 00000000 00000000 00000000 01110001`.
- The bitwise not `~` operator will negate `q` and all its bits will be inverted `11111111 11111111 11111111 10001110`.
- There is a problem here, the result of left shifting an negative number `signed int` is undefined.
- This excerpt from the book above (Â§ 4.11.1, p.160) explain better the conversion.

`"The types bool, char, signed char, unsigned char, short, and unsigned
short are promoted to int if all possible values of that type fit in an int.
Otherwise, the value is promoted to unsigned int."`

### Exercise 4.26:

*In our grading example in this section, what would happen if we used `unsigned int` as the type for `quiz1`?*

**Answer**

- In the C++ specification an `integer` type can store from 8 bits `uint8_t` to 64 bits `uint64_t`, so if `unsigned int` is at least `uint32_t`, this example will work as expected, otherwise the the students number greater than 8 or 16 will be discarded.


For more information about width, please access [C++11 reference for types.](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types)


### Exercise 4.27: 

*What is the result of each of these expressions?*

```cpp
unsigned long ul1 = 3, ul2 = 7;

(a) ul1 & ul2
(b) ul1 | ul2
(c) ul1 && ul2
(d) ul1 || ul2
```

**Answer**

- **(a)** - `00000011` & `00000111` = `00000011`
- **(b)** - `00000011` | `00000111` = `00000111`
- **(c)** - `true` && `true` = `true`
- **(d)** - `true` || `true` = `true`

## 4.9. The sizeof Operator

### [Exercise 4.28:](Exercise_28/Ex28.cpp)

*Write a program to print the size of each of the built-in types.*

### [Exercise 4.29:](Exercise_29/Ex29.cpp) 

*Predict the output of the following code and explain your reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected? If not, figure out why.*

```cpp
int x[10]; int *p = x;

cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;
cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;
```

**Answer**

- The first output will calculate the size of this array in witch is equal to 10. The width of the array x is equal to 40 divided by the width of the first item in that array equal to 4 Bytes.
- The second output will give the width of a pointer = 8 divided by the width of the type pointed by *p = 4. The result is 2 but it`s meaningless.

ps: In 64 bits system a pointer has 64 bits.

### Exercise 4.30: 

*Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to match the default evaluation:*
```cpp
(a) sizeof x + y
(b) sizeof p->mem[i]
(c) sizeof a < b
(d) sizeof f()
```

**Answer**

```cpp
(a) (sizeof x) + y
(b) sizeof (p->mem[i])
(c) (sizeof a) < b
(d) (sizeof f())
```

## 4.10. Comma Operator

### [Exercise 4.31:](Exercise_31/Ex31.cpp)

*The program in this section used the prefix increment and decrement operators. Explain why we used `prefix` and not `postfix`. What changes would have to be made to use the `postfix` versions? Rewrite the program using `postfix` operators.*

**Answer**

- We use `prefix` just as a precautious, it's safer to use `prefix` because `postfix` stores the original value as a temporary variable, therefore postfix is heavier.
- This book gives the advice on section Â§4.5,  `Advice: Use Postfix Operators only When Necessary`.

### Exercise 4.32: 

*Explain the following loop.*

```cpp
constexpr int size = 5;
int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5};

for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0; 
    ix != size && ptr != ia+size;
    ++ix, ++ptr) { 
    /* ... */ 
}
```

**Answer**

- It is about using two variable that do the same thing, both `ptr` and `ix` do iterations thought this for with the exactly the same results and behaviors. It has a  redundance of iterators.


### Exercise 4.33: 

*Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression does:*

```cpp
someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y
```

**Answer**

- Coma has lower precedence than the conditional operator, as we can see the real behavior below:

    ```cpp
    (someValue ? (++x), (++y) : (--x) ), (--y)
    ```

    - First all increment operators will be performed `(someValue ? x, y : x ), y`
    - If `somevalue` is true the result is equal to `x, y`, if not the result is equal to `x`.
    - As Coma operator start from the left to right the result of `x, y` will be `y` if it`s true.
    - If `somevalue` is true the expression will follow `y, y`, otherwise it will be `x, y`.

## 4.11. Type Conversions

### Exercise 4.34: 

*Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions, Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators.*

```cpp
(a) if (fval)
(b) dval = fval + ival;
(c) dval + ival * cval;
```
**Answer**

- **(a)** - `fval` will be converted to bool.
- **(b)** - `ival` will be converted to `fval` type `float` and the result will be converted to `double`.
- **(c)** - `cval` will be promoted to `int` and then `double`, `ival` will be converted to `double`.

### Exercise 4.35:

*Given the following definitions:*
```cpp
char cval; int ival; unsigned int ui;
float fval; double dval;
```
*Identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:*

```cpp
(a) cval = 'a' + 3;
(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
(c) dval = ui * fval;
(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;
```

**Answer**

- **(a)** - `'a'` will be promoted to `int`, the result `'a' + 3` will be converted to `char`.
- **(b)** - `ival` and `ui` will be converted to double, the result will be converted to `float`.
- **(c)** - `ui` will be converted to `float` and then the result to `double`.
- **(d)** - `ival` and `fval` will be converted `double` and then to `char`.

## 4.11.3. Explicit Conversions

### Exercise 4.36:

*Assuming `i` is an `int` and `d` is a `double` write the expression `i *= d` so that it does integral, rather than floating-point, multiplication.*

**Answer

```cpp
i *= static_cast<int>(d); 
```

### Exercise 4.37: 
*Rewrite each of the following old-style casts to use a named cast:*

```cpp
int i; double d; const string *ps;*pv;
(a) pv = (void*)ps;
(b) i = int(*pc);
(c) pv = &d;
(d) pc = (char*) pv;
```
**Answer**

```cpp
(a) pv = const_cast<void*>(ps);
(b) i = static_cast<int>(*pc);
(c) pv = static_cast(&d);
(d) pc = const_cast<char*>(pv);
```

### Exercise 4.38: 

*Explain the following expression:*

```cpp
double slope = static_cast<double>(j/i);
```

**Answer**

- This expression's cast will get as result an `double` truncated, in another word, data will be lost.
- The division of two `ints` yields as result an `int`, in order to get a floating point division, at least one of its operands has to be converted to `double`, as we can see bellow.

    ```cpp
    double slope = static_cast<double>(j)/i;
    // or
    double slope = j/static_cast<double>(i);
    // or
    double slope = static_cast<double>(j)/static_cast<double>(i)
    ```
